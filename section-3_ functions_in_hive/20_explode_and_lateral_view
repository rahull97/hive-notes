explode() -> It takes array as an input and output the elements of array as separate rows.

example -> select explode(col2) as my_col from table1;

The limitation of explode function is that, we can only SELECT THE COLUMN TO BE EXPLODED
in our select statement. In other words, we cannot select other columns of the table along
with exploded column.

---

lateral view ->  It overcomes the limitation of the explode function. We can select any
                 number of columns along with exploded column in select statment.

Working ->  It first explodes the column and store that column inside a virtual table.
Then it performs join operation between the base table and the virtual table to give the final output.


example ->

    select author_name,
    dummy_booksname
    from table2
    lateral view explode(books_name) dummy as dummy_booksname;  # dummy is VIRTUAL TABLE name  and dummy_booksname is exploded column name in virtual table.


lateral view can also be used to separate the key and value of map data type into separate columns

# col1 which is of map data type is exploded and stored into a virtual table consisting of two columns named key and value.
example -> 
    select key, value from table3 lateral view explode(col1) dummy as key,value;
