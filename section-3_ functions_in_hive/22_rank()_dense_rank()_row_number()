1. rank() -> It gives the ranking within ORDERED PARTITION. 
             Ties are assigned the same rank, with the next
             ranking(s) skipped.

2. dense_rank() -> It gives the ranking within ORDERED PARTITION,
                   but the ranks are consecutive. 
                   No ranks are skipped even if there are ties.

3. row_number() -> It assigns unique numbers to each row WITHIN the
                   PARTITION given the order by clause.

Examples:

1.  select name, 
    transaction_amount, 
    rank() over(order by transaction_amount desc)    # since we are using order by it will use only single reducer.
    from table1;

2.  select name,
    transaction_amount,
    dense_rank() over(order by transaction_amount desc)
    from table1;

3.  select name,
    transaction_amount,
    row_number() over(order by transaction_amount desc)
    from table1;

4.  select name,
    transaction_amount,
    row_number() over(partition by name order by transaction_amount desc)
    from table1;
