tablesampling: 

It means to take a sample of data in a fashion manner.

In other words, tablesampling collects the data in a
distributed manner from a number of buckets.

Thus it allows us to have handy realistic sample dataset.

"limit" cannot give us such realistic sample, as it may fetch data from a single partition and single bucket.

===

table sampling command:

SELECT deptno, empname, sal, location 
FROM dept_buck
TABLESAMPLE (bucket 1 out of 2 on location); 

explaination:

1.  dept_buck table is created using 4 buckets for each partition.

2.  meaning of "TABLESAMPLE (bucket 1 out of 2 on location)"
    
    Divide 4 buckets into groups of 2 bucket each and 
    then select first bucket of every group;

===

tablesampling can be done on any column even on non-bucketed column, but 
in that case it will require more time, as it needs to scan entire table
and than fetch the sample.

Thus it is recommended to do table sampling on bucketed column.

===

Sampling can also be done using some other parameters like percentage
or number of rows.

They come under "block sampling".

example:

SELECT deptno, empname, sal, location 
FROM dept_buck
TABLESAMPLE (2 percent); # pick atleast 2 % of the dataset.

SELECT deptno, empname, sal, location 
FROM dept_buck
TABLESAMPLE (1M); # pick atleast 1 MB of data as a sample.

SELECT deptno, empname, sal, location 
FROM dept_buck
TABLESAMPLE (20 rows); # pick 20 rows from each input split.
