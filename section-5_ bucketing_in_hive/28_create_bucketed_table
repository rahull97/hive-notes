===
By default bucketing is not enabled.

We can enable it using following command:
set hive.enforce.bucketing = true;

Create a bucketed table:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dept_buck (deptno int, empname string, sal int, location string)
PARTITIONED BY (deptname string)
CLUSTERED BY (location) INTO 4 BUCKETS  # bucketing step.
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

insert data into a table using dynamic partitioning

INSERT INTO TABLE dept_buck PARTITION(deptname) 
SELECT dept,name,sal,loc,dept_name from dept_with_loc; 

Number of reducing tasks = number of buckets.

Key points.

1.  Bucket is physically a file.

2.  We can explictly set the number of buckets during table creation.

3.  Bucketing can sometimes be more efficient when used alone.

4.  Bucketed Map Joins are the fastest joins.

    Condition to perform Bucket Map Joins on two tables:
    
    Both joining tables should be bucketed on same column as of
    joining column and both tables should have equal number of
    buckets.
