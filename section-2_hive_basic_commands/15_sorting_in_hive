To sort our data in Hive, we have four clauses:

1.  order by
2.  sort by
3.  distribute by
4.  cluster by

---
order by command:
    It is used for full sorting of the data. It guarantees total ordering of data,
    and for that it has to be passed through SINGLE REDUCER. 
    Thus it uses single reducer for sorting of data.
    In strict mode, the order by clasue must be followed by limit by clause.
 
query example:
    select col2 from table2 order by col2;


---
sort by command:
    It also does sorts data but within a REDUCER. It can use more than ONE REDUCER to 
    a SORT a data. Thus sort by clause does not guarantees the full sorting(ordering)
    of the data.

query example:
    select col2 from table2 sort by col2;


---
distribute by command:
    Hive uses distribute by clause to distribute the key value pairs among the reducers.
    It decides which key will go to which reducers. 
    It ensures that all the rows with same distribute by column value will go to the 
    same reducer.
    It simply distributes the data amongst the reducers.
    Thus there is no overlapping of the data with same distribute by column value amongst the different 
    reducers.

    To do sorting we can combine it with the sort by clause.

query example:
    select col1, col2 from table2 distribute by col2 sort by col2;
                            or
    select col1, col2 from table2 cluster by col2;

---
cluster by = distribute by sort by

query example:
    select col1, col2 from table2 cluster by col2;
