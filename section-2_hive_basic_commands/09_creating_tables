There are two types of table created in Hive:

1.  External table - Hive is only responsible for table's metadata
2.  Internal table - Hive is the sole owner of table's data, as well as metadata

If we drop an Internal table in Hive, than both metadata and actual data
is lost.

If we drop an External table in Hive, only metadata is lost.

By Default Hive creates an INTERNAL table.

create table commands:

1.  create table if not exists table1 (col1 string, col2 array<string>, col3 string, col4 int) 
    row format delimited 
    fields terminated by ',' 
    collection items terminated by ':'
    lines terminated by '\n'
    stored as textfile;

2.  external table creation:

    create external table if not exists table2 (col1 string, col2 array<string>, col3 string, col4 int) 
    row format delimited 
    fields terminated by ',' 
    collection items terminated by ':'
    lines terminated by '\n'
    stored as textfile;

3.  get loaction of all the databases and tables stored:
    if location is not mentioned while creating tables, by default they are stored at a below mentioned, config value.
    command = set hive.metastore.warehouse.dir;
    output (by default) = hive.metastore.warehouse.dir = /user/hive/warehouse


4.  store table in some other location, other than hive.metastore.warehouse.dir, 
    then we have to explicitly mention that path from HDFS, during table creation.

    create table if not exists table3 (col1 string, col2 array<string>, col3 string, col4 int) 
    row format delimited 
    fields terminated by ',' 
    collection items terminated by ':'
    lines terminated by '\n'
    stored as textfile
    location '/user/rahul/table3';

5.  after table creation we have to load a file in it or we can say link the metadata to our file

    local keyword is used if we want to load data from local filesystem and not from HDFS.
    
    load data local inpath '/home/rahul/data.txt' into table table1; # into is used to append the data.

    load data inpath 'path/on/hdfs';

    load data local inpath '/home/rahul/data.txt' overwrite table table1;
