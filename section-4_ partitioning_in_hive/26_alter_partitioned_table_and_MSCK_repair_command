In real time we have to add/drop partitions off a table very frequently.
===
Command to see the partitions inside a table:
    show partitions part_dept1;

Drop partition of a table:
    alter table part_dept1 drop partition (deptname='HR');

In case of internal table, metadata and partition data is deleted.
In case of external table, metadata is deleted, that is we cannot
query partition data through Hive, but the partition data in HDFS 
is not deleted.

===
Add partition in a table:
    alter table part_dept1 add partition (deptname="Dev");

    load data local inpath '/home/user/dev' into table part_dept1 partition(deptname="Dev");

===
Command to update the metadata of Hive table, in case new partitions are added directly in HDFS:
    msck repair table part_dept1;
