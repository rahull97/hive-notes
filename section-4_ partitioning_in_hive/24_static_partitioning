In Hive partitioning can be done in two ways:

1.  Static partitioning
2.  Dynamic partitioning

===
In Static partitioning, we have to load data into its respective partitions manually.

1.  create a partitioned table example:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS PART_DEPT (deptno int, empname string, sal int)
PARTITIONED BY (deptname string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

In case of static partitioning, on whatever column we are doing static partitioning,
that column should not be included in create statement.

2.  insert data into partitioned table

INSERT INTO PART_DEPT 
PARTITION (deptname="HR")
SELECT col1, col3, col4 FROM dept WHERE col2 = "HR";

3.  We can also directly load static partitions using load command.
    But in that case, our data should be segregated priorly on partition column.

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/user/act' INTO TABLE part_dept PARTITION (deptname="accounts");
